The repository includes a png image for an example map which you can use to localize on in both simulation and for the final challenge demo day. However, you are welcome to and completely capable of making your own maps since you know the exact track dimensions. Closer to the demo day, we will set up both events in the basement for testing in real life. Ultimately, we will also provide you with final maps that exactly match the final courses you will be operating in.
